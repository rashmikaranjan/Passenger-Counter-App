# Passenger Counter App

A tiny, single-page web app that counts people entering a location. Built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript so it's easy to run locally.

## Features
- Increment a live counter
- Save previous counts (appends entries with a dash separator)
- Resets the live counter after saving

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `index.css` — styling
- `index.js` — simple counter logic (increment and save functions)
- `station.jpg` — background image used by the page

## Run / Try it
- Open the file directly in your browser:

```bash
# from the project folder, double-click index.html or open it from your browser
open index.html
```
